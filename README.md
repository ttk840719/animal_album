# Simple Animal Album

This is the first time I tried using Ruby. I created this simple web application by using the Ruby on Rails framework, and by following the steps on this YouTube video:
(How To Build A Recipe Box In Rails 4 - Mackenzie Child) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhdzE1yNs-0 

The web app can do the followings:

1. User can create an account, sign in, and sign out.
2. A signed in user can upload and edit an image, and write descriptions. (all three are required fields)
3. A signed in user can delete images it upload.
4. Users that are not signed in can also view the photos.
